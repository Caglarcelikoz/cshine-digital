          <strong>Website:</strong> When you visit our website, certain data is
          recorded through cookies (including your IP address) to maintain and
          enhance our website. More information about these cookies can be found

          our services as a (potential) customer or partner, we process your
          full name, contact information (email address, phone number, office
          and/or residential address), and other data necessary for orders,
          invoicing, or collaboration (such as bank details, contact history, or
          data related to your previous orders).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Marketing:</strong> If you grant us explicit permission, we
          process your full name and email address for sending direct marketing,
          newsletters, promotions, and actions related to our products and
          services. You can always unsubscribe easily.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        While you are never obliged to disclose personal data, refusing to
        provide necessary information may hinder or make it impossible for us to
        provide our services.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Processing Purposes</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        We process personal data for general customer and order management or to
        deliver our services. This includes customer administration, order
        tracking and delivery, invoicing, answering questions, and marketing.
        Processing is based on the following legal grounds:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
        <li>Based on your consent;</li>
        <li>Necessary for the performance of a contract;</li>
        <li>Necessary to comply with a legal obligation;</li>
        <li>
          Necessary for the pursuit of our legitimate interests in conducting
          business.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Where personal data processing is based on your explicit consent, you
        have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
        3. Sharing with Third Parties
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        If necessary to achieve the stated purposes, we may share personal data
        with employees and professional partners. Our partners, in turn, will
        take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect this
        personal data. We will never commercialize your personal data to third
        parties. In the event of a potential reorganization, bankruptcy, or
        transfer of business activities, data related to our business operations
        may be transferred to third parties. In limited cases, we may also be
        obliged to share personal data based on a court order or mandatory
        legislation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Retention Period</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        We retain your personal data for as long as necessary for the purposes
        for which it is processed. To determine the appropriate retention
        period, we consider the quantity, nature, and sensitivity of the
        personal data, the reasons for processing, and whether we can achieve
        those purposes through other means. We must also consider periods for
        which we may need to retain personal data to comply with our legal
        obligations or handle complaints, queries, and protect our legal rights
        in case of a claim. When we no longer need your personal data, we will
        securely delete or destroy it. We will also consider how we can reduce
        the personal data we use over time and whether we can anonymize your
        personal data so that it can no longer be linked to you or identify you,
        in which case we may use this information without further notice to you.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Your Rights</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Security</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        We implement at least the customary technical and organizational
        security measures that can reasonably be expected of us to protect your
        personal data against destruction, loss, alteration, falsification,
        distribution, or unauthorized access. Personal data will only be
        transferred to a partner in a country outside the European Economic Area
        if that country guarantees an appropriate level of protection for your
        personal data. Before sharing personal data with a partner in the United
        States of America, we require a separate processing agreement or
        certification under the Privacy Shield Framework (
        <a
          href="www.privacyshield.gov"

          www.privacyshield.gov
        </a>
        ). We cannot be held liable for incorrect or unlawful use of personal
        data by a third party. You remain responsible for the confidentiality
        and use of your computer, IP address, login, and identification data.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">8. Your Privacy</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Your privacy is important to us. We make every effort to protect it and
        attach great importance to compliance with (i) the Law of 8 December
        1992 on the protection of privacy with regard to the processing of
        personal data (as amended by the Law of 11 December 1998, &quot;Data
        Processing Act&quot;); (ii) the anti-spam provisions of Book XII of the
        Economic Law Code regarding the right of the electronic economy; and
        (iii) European Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of
        personal data (&quot;General Data Protection Regulation&quot;).
