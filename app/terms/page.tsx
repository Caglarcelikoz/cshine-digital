          These terms and conditions apply to all quotations, offers,
          activities, orders, agreements, and deliveries of services or products
          by or on behalf of C-Shine Digital. Deviations from these conditions

          deviating terms and conditions of the customer or third parties are
          expressly excluded.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Offers and Quotations</h2>
        <p>
          Offers and quotations from C-Shine Digital are without obligation
          unless expressly stated otherwise. An offer or quotation is valid for
          14 days from the date of issue, unless otherwise stated in the offer
          or quotation. If the customer does not accept an offer or quotation
          within the applicable period, the offer or quotation expires unless

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. Acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          The customer must explicitly and in writing accept the offer. If the
          customer fails to do so but still agrees or gives the impression that
          C-Shine Digital is carrying out work as part of the agreement, the
          offer is considered accepted. C-Shine Digital reserves the right to
          refuse an assignment if new information becomes available after
          acceptance that makes execution by C-Shine Digital unacceptable. After
          acceptance, the agreement can only be changed with mutual consent. In
          this case, C-Shine Digital is entitled to adjust the price for the
          agreement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">5. Execution of an Assignment</h2>
        <p>
          C-Shine Digital will execute the assignment to the best of its
          knowledge and ability and in accordance with the requirements of good
          craftsmanship, in the style in which C-Shine Digital typically works.
          C-Shine Digital will make every effort and act to the best of its
          ability in the given circumstances during the execution of the
          assignment. The execution of the assignment is done in consultation
          and upon written agreement and payment of any agreed-upon advance by
          the customer. The customer is obliged to do and refrain from all that
          is reasonably necessary and desirable to enable timely and correct
          execution of the assignment. If the customer has not ensured that
          C-Shine Digital can start the execution of the agreement in a timely
          manner, any additional costs and/or additional hours resulting from
          this are at the expense of the customer.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">6. Intellectual Property</h2>

          C-Shine Digital reserves all intellectual property rights with regard
          to products of the mind that it uses or has used and/or develops or
          has developed in the context of the execution of the agreement and

          invoice date, unless otherwise agreed in writing. If the customer does
          not pay on time, they are automatically in default and liable for
          statutory interest. All judicial and extrajudicial costs incurred by
          C-Shine Digital as a result of the customer's non-compliance are fully
          borne by the customer.

          8. Cancellation and Termination
        </h2>
        <p>
          C-Shine Digital reserves the right to cancel or suspend the agreement
          with immediate effect in the event of bankruptcy, suspension of
          payments, debt restructuring, attachment, or other circumstances that
          deprive the customer of free disposal of their assets. Cancellation or
          termination does not release the customer from their payment
          obligations. In the event of cancellation by the customer, the
          customer is obligated to reimburse C-Shine Digital for all reasonably
          incurred costs related to the execution of the agreement.

        <p>
          C-Shine Digital is only liable for direct damage suffered by the
          customer as a result of an attributable shortcoming of C-Shine Digital
          in the performance of the agreement. C-Shine Digital is never liable
          for indirect damages, such as consequential damages, loss of profit,
          savings, or damage to third parties.
