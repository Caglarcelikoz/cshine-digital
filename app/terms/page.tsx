                activities, orders, agreements, and deliveries of services or
                products by or on behalf of C-Shine Digital. Deviations from

                Additional and/or deviating terms and conditions of the customer
                or third parties are expressly excluded.

            </Section>

            <Section title="3. Offers and Quotations">
              <p>
                Offers and quotations from C-Shine Digital are without
                obligation unless expressly stated otherwise. An offer or
                quotation is valid for 14 days from the date of issue, unless
                otherwise stated in the offer or quotation. If the customer does
                not accept an offer or quotation within the applicable period,
                the offer or quotation expires unless otherwise agreed in
                writing.

            <Section title="4. Acceptance">
              <p>
                The customer must explicitly and in writing accept the offer. If
                the customer fails to do so but still agrees or gives the
                impression that C-Shine Digital is carrying out work as part of
                the agreement, the offer is considered accepted. C-Shine Digital
                reserves the right to refuse an assignment if new information
                becomes available after acceptance that makes execution by
                C-Shine Digital unacceptable. After acceptance, the agreement
                can only be changed with mutual consent. In this case, C-Shine
                Digital is entitled to adjust the price for the agreement.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="5. Execution of an Assignment">
              <p>
                C-Shine Digital will execute the assignment to the best of its
                knowledge and ability and in accordance with the requirements of
                good craftsmanship, in the style in which C-Shine Digital
                typically works. C-Shine Digital will make every effort and act
                to the best of its ability in the given circumstances during the
                execution of the assignment. The execution of the assignment is
                done in consultation and upon written agreement and payment of
                any agreed-upon advance by the customer. The customer is obliged
                to do and refrain from all that is reasonably necessary and
                desirable to enable timely and correct execution of the
                assignment. If the customer has not ensured that C-Shine Digital
                can start the execution of the agreement in a timely manner, any
                additional costs and/or additional hours resulting from this are
                at the expense of the customer.

            </Section>

            <Section title="6. Intellectual Property">
              <p>
                C-Shine Digital reserves all intellectual property rights with
                regard to products of the mind that it uses or has used and/or
                develops or has developed in the context of the execution of the
                agreement and with respect to which it has or can claim
                copyright or other intellectual property rights.

            </Section>

            <Section title="7. Payment">
              <p>
                The customer must pay C-Shine Digital&apos;s invoices within 30 days
                of the invoice date, unless otherwise agreed in writing. If the
                customer does not pay on time, they are automatically in default
                and liable for statutory interest. All judicial and
                extrajudicial costs incurred by C-Shine Digital as a result of
                the customer&apos;s non-compliance are fully borne by the customer.

            </Section>

            <Section title="8. Cancellation and Termination">
              <p>
                C-Shine Digital reserves the right to cancel or suspend the
                agreement with immediate effect in the event of bankruptcy,
                suspension of payments, debt restructuring, attachment, or other
                circumstances that deprive the customer of free disposal of
                their assets. Cancellation or termination does not release the
                customer from their payment obligations. In the event of
                cancellation by the customer, the customer is obligated to
                reimburse C-Shine Digital for all reasonably incurred costs
                related to the execution of the agreement.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="9. Liability">
              <p>
                C-Shine Digital is only liable for direct damage suffered by the
                customer as a result of an attributable shortcoming of C-Shine
                Digital in the performance of the agreement. C-Shine Digital is
                never liable for indirect damages, such as consequential
                damages, loss of profit, savings, or damage to third parties.

            <Section title="10. Complaints">
              <p>
                Complaints about the work performed or the invoice must be
                reported in writing within 3 days after discovering the defect,
                but no later than 14 days after completion of the relevant work,
                to C-Shine Digital. The customer must provide C-Shine Digital
                the opportunity to investigate a complaint.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="11. Applicable Law and Disputes">
              <p>
                All agreements between C-Shine Digital and the customer are
                subject to the laws of Belgium. Disputes arising from an
                agreement between C-Shine Digital and the customer that cannot
                be resolved by mutual agreement will be submitted to the
                competent court in the district of Limburg, Belgium.
